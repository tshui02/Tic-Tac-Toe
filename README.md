# Tic-Tac-Toe
## What is it?
First proper JS project, literally the most basic Tic Tac Toe game possible.  

## Features
-Two player mode  
-Colours!  
-The game will check if either player wins  
-that's about it lol

## Possible Other Features?
-Better dialog box (which player won? what if there is a tie?)  
-One player mode (vs computer)
